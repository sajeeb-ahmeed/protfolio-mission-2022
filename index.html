                    perfect way to learn Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those books.
                    Someone else may say, read blogs on that website. I say, there is no perfect way to learn. Whatever
                    anyone recommends, check it out. If you like it, continue. If you don‚Äôt like it, Google it or search
                    on YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you have tried out multiple
                    ways for a few weeks, you will find out your own way to learn. So, don‚Äôt try to fit hard on other‚Äôs
                    way, instead, build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!
